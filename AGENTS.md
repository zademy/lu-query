## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in GitHub Issues (zademy/lu-query); use the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical triage roles use their default label strings (needs-triage, needs-info, ready-for-agent, ready-for-human, wontfix). See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context: one `GLOSSARY.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

### Git flow

`master` advances only through PRs from `develop` (#53-#56). Never merge `develop` into `master` locally and never push `master` directly: the PR merges are the commits that make the two branches diverge, so a local merge duplicates that work and puts them out of step. A release is: push `develop`, open the PR, let GitHub merge it.

Before every commit, run the whole local gate, not just the files you touched: `npm run format:check` (prettier checks the entire repo and CI will too), `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, `npm run build`. A green check on a subset of files is not a green gate.

## antislop
For UI, copy, people, mobile layout, or code comments work, read these installed skill files directly (use these paths even if a same-named global skill exists):
- Core filter, always on: `antislop`: `.opencode/skills/antislop/SKILL.md`
- UI / visual: `antislop-ui`: `.opencode/skills/antislop-ui/SKILL.md`
- Copy & text: `antislop-copywriting`: `.opencode/skills/antislop-copywriting/SKILL.md`
- People: `antislop-human`: `.opencode/skills/antislop-human/SKILL.md`
- Mobile / responsive: `antislop-layoutmobile`: `.opencode/skills/antislop-layoutmobile/SKILL.md`
- Code comments: `antislop-code`: `.opencode/skills/antislop-code/SKILL.md`
Before starting, follow the core's "Two Usage Modes" section in strict order: explicit session instruction first, then global preference, then ask. A session instruction always wins. For a resolved mode, say `antislop active: <mode> (session override).` or `antislop active: <mode> (global preference).` once before presenting findings or making edits, using the actual mode and source. Acknowledging the user's request without naming the source does not replace this notice.
Only an explicit choice of antislop during or after selects a session mode. A request to review, audit, or avoid file edits does not select a mode; read the global preference in that case. Another skill's mode does not select antislop's mode.
If the mode is unresolved, ask during/after and end the response; wait for the answer before any UI review, planning, or concept. For read-only tasks, put the active-mode notice only at the start of the final answer, never in progress messages. For editing tasks, announce before the first edit and omit it from the final answer.
To update antislop later: `npx antislop-ai --update`, or run `npx antislop-ai` and pick Overwrite them.

## Groma

This project uses Groma. Before you scan, inspect, or curate architecture, or change files for a Backlog task, run `groma agent-instructions` and read the guide it names for that job. When it reports a first scan, ask the user whether they want you to curate the architecture. Do not edit Groma-owned architecture files directly.

## Backlog.md Workflow

This project uses Backlog.md for task and project management.

**At the beginning of each conversation in this project, run `backlog instructions overview` before answering or taking action. Re-read it only if you have not read it yet in the current conversation.**

Use the overview to decide whether to search, read, create, or update Backlog tasks.

Before task lifecycle actions, read the matching detailed guide:
- `backlog instructions task-creation` before creating or splitting tasks
- `backlog instructions task-execution` before planning, changing status or assignee, adding a plan or implementation notes, or implementing task work
- `backlog instructions task-finalization` before checking acceptance criteria, writing final summaries, or moving tasks to terminal statuses

Use `backlog <command> --help` before running unfamiliar commands. Help shows options, fields, and examples.

Do not edit Backlog task, draft, document, decision, or milestone markdown files directly. Use the `backlog` CLI so metadata, relationships, and history stay consistent.
